\subsection{Probability}
\begin{ques} Given the probability of coin head is $p$. What is the expected number to get three heads in a row?
\end{ques}
\begin{proof}
We use a standard Markov chain argument.  Let $\mu_i$ denote the expected number of tosses to get $3$ heads after the first $i$ heads in a row.  We have the system
\begin{align*}
\mu_0 &= p(1 + \mu_1) + q(1 + \mu_0), \\
\mu_1 &= p(1 + \mu_2) + q(1 + \mu_0) ,\\
\mu_2 &= p(1) + q(1 + \mu_0).
\end{align*}
Solving the system for $\mu_0$, we obtain
$$\mu_0 = \frac{1 + p + p^2}{p^3} = \frac{1}{p^3} + \frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{p}$$

Another way to solve the equation is as follows:
\begin{align*}
\mu_0 &= \frac{1}{q}(\mu_0 + 1) + \frac{1}{pq}(\mu_0 + 2) + \frac{1}{p^2q}(\mu_0 + 3) + \frac{1}{p^3}(3) \\
%&= \frac{\mu_0}{q}\left(1 + \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{p^2}\right) + \frac{1}{q}\left( \right)\\ 
\end{align*}


\end{proof}
\begin{ques} What is a martingale?  List a few examples.

\begin{ques} You have $r$ red balls, $w$ white balls in a bag. If you keep drawing balls out of the bag until the bag now only contains balls of a single color (i.e. you run out of a color) what is the probability you run out of white balls first? (in terms of $r$ and $w$).
\end{ques}

\begin{ques} Given $\log X \sim N(0,1)$, compute the expectation of X.

\subsection{Brain Teasers}
\begin{ques} You are holding two eggs in a 100-story building. If an egg is thrown out of the window, it will not break if the floor number is less than X, and it will always break if the floor number is equal to or greater than X. What strategy would you use to determine X with the minimum number of drops in a worst case scenario?
\end{ques}

\begin{ques}
You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each containing money. One contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope at will, but before inspecting it, you are given the chance to switch envelopes. Should you switch? 
\end{ques}

\begin{ques} Suppose there are 10 lions and a meat. If anyone of the lions eats the meat, she falls asleep. While she is sleeping, any other lion can eat her and also fall asleep. And so on. The question is, what will happen at the beginning? Will any lion eat the meat?
\end{ques}

\begin{ques} Given $3n$ people that the $i$-th person can pass a test with probability $p_i$,
now you are required to divide them to $n$ groups that each group has $3$ people.
The score of one group equals $1$ if at least two people pass the test, $0$ otherwise.
In order to maximize the expectation of total score, how do you group them?
